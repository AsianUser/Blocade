Wyrm Class
- instance variables are owner address, health, strength, defense, and crit%
- setters for updating variables
- upgrade function that allows the user to burn tokens to upgrade their wyrms stats
- heal function that requires the user to burn tokens to heal back health

Battle Class
- instance variables are the two wyms and the number of rounds
- computes the result of each round using a random number and multiplying by its stats
    - each wyrm attacks the other using its strength
    - if first random number < crit% double the damage
    - if second random number < defense, block the attack and damage
- updates the wyrms health according to the results of the rounds

Game Mechanics / UI
- anyone can create a wyrm and its stats will depend on how many tokens they burn to mint its
- the free wyrm will have the equivalent stats as a wyrm created with 1 token and can only battle other free wyrms
- to battle any wyrm user will input the wyrm they want to battle and the number of rounds they want to fight for
    - the computer will then calculate the results of the match and show some animation
    - the appropriate health updates will be applied
