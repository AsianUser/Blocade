Wheeler - (Wyatt)
	Variables
		Uint256: wheelSpeed
		Boolean: wheelIsSpinning
		Boolean: isSlowingDown
		Uint256: tokenAmount
		Uint256: winAmount
		Uint256: randomNumberForSlowing
	Methods
		def spinWheel()
            If the button for start spin is clicked, this method will run
            It begins the spin for the wheel, and instantly assigns a circular speed for the wheel
		def tokenCommit(Uint256: _betAmount, Address: _userAddress)
            Before clicking the spin wheel button, the user that is currently operating the computer is prompted with a bet amount that is automatically linked to the current wallet ID that they have signed in with. This places a token commit on the wheel spin, and removes the token amount from the user's account.
		def winTokens(Uint256: _winAmount, Address: _userAddress)
            If the Funball lands on the color that the user committed tokens to, they will win some multiplier of whatever amount of tokens they put down and it will be transferred into their wallet. This will be facilitated through smart contracts
		Def slowingLogic(Uint256: _randomSlowingNumber)
            The number will be a random hash that is non-duplicatable.
            The first and last characters of the number will be the amount of times the ball bounces, and the rest of the characters will decide how much to scale the speed of the wheel by.
    How do we scale the velocity based on numbers? We will need to figure out the logic for this
