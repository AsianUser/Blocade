DESIGN:
Wheeler - (Wyatt)
Course Module: Development of Interactive Arcade Games
Section 1: Overview of Wheeler - A Family-Friendly Arcade Game
Game Concept:
-Title: Wheeler
-Target Audience: Families and arcade enthusiasts
-Core Mechanic: Predicting the outcome of a spinning wheel
Gameplay Description:
-Players use tokens to make predictions on a color (green or blue) on a spinning wheel.
-The wheel features vibrant, alternating green and blue slots.
-A ball, referred to as the Funball, is released onto the spinning wheel.
-If the Funball lands on the color selected by the player, they earn points.
Objective:
-To collect the highest number of points through accurate predictions.
Section 2: Game Design Elements
Mechanics:
-Prediction: Players use their tokens on a turn, and then they select the place where they want the ball to land (blue or green slot). The wheel spins *extremely* fast which makes it so players cannot accurately predict where the ball will stop, and it turns into the shell of a skill-based game
-Results: The outcome is determined by where the Funball lands on the wheel after you choose for the wheel to stop.
-Aesthetics:
-The wheel is designed to be bright and appealing, with clear, contrasting colors to capture players’ attention.
-Engaging animations for the spinning wheel and the motion of the Funball add to the game's excitement.
Technology:
-Utilizes physics-based animations to simulate the natural movement of the spinning wheel and Funball.
-Designed for both standalone arcade machines and digital platforms, ensuring wide
accessibility.
Section 3: Educational Objectives
Understanding Probability:
- Introduces players to the concept of probability through gameplay, helping them understand the likelihood of various outcomes.
Cognitive Skills Development:

- Enhances players’ prediction and reasoning abilities as they decide which color to select based on observed patterns.
	- Isn’t this just a 50/50 chance, there’s not really much skill involved, so I’m wondering if this game will eventually get boring to users, or what will motivate them to play
	It’s like not a 50/50 chance really. You choose where you want the wheel to slow down so there is another factor involved through user control on top of the 50/50 chance
	- Will there be zeros like there are on roulette so that we have a cut
	Yeah we can do this
Engagement and Interaction:
-Promotes interaction and competition among players in a fun and safe environment.
Section 4: Implementation and Testing
Development Tools:
-Game development software for creating responsive and engaging arcade experiences.
-Use of real-time data tracking to refine gameplay balance and ensure fairness.
Testing Phases:
-Alpha testing: In-house testing to refine game dynamics and interface usability.
-Beta testing: Public testing in select arcade locations to gather wide-ranging player feedback.
-Release: Final tweaks and widespread deployment across arcade centers.
Iterative Feedback Incorporation:
-Continuous updates to game mechanics and features based on user engagement metrics and direct feedback.
Section 5: Conclusion and Future Directions
Game Impact:
-Aimed at providing an engaging and dynamic arcade experience that challenges both mind and reflexes.
- how does this challenge both mind and reflexes if the wheel spins too fast to see the 
	There is an aspect of skill because you choose where to slow the wheel to a stop. 
-Focuses on bringing people together in a competitive yet playful setting.
Expansion Potential:
-Possibility of introducing more colors and interactive elements to increase the game’s complexity and replay value.
Community Building:
-Development of a community platform for players to share scores, tips, and engage in events, enhancing the arcade gaming experience.
